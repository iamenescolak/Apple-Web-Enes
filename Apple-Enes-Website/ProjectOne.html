            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>This case study focuses on the design and development process of
                Notefege, a
                mobile app designed to assist users in reading sheet music and
                understanding
                solfege. The goal was to create a user-friendly app with high
                fidelity designs
                within a two-week deadline. This article provides an overview of
                the typography,
                colors, research, personas, wireframes, low fidelity and high
                fidelity designs,
                as well as usability studies conducted. All of this was done with Figma.</p>
            <p>The goal of creating Notefege was to design and develop a
                user-friendly mobile
                app that helps individuals, regardless of their level of music
                theory knowledge,
                in reading sheet music and understanding solfege. The app aims
                to provide a
                seamless and intuitive experience for users, allowing them to
                easily access and
                interpret sheet music, play the pitch of notes, set the desired
                Beats Per Minute
                (BPM), and enhance their music theory understanding. The
                ultimate objective is
                to ensure that users, whether beginners or experienced
                musicians, can
                confidently read sheet music and enjoy a smoother music learning
                and playing
                experience.</p>

            Through creating an empathy map and developing a primary persona named "Users,"
            I gained valuable insights into their preferences and motivations. This deep
            understanding guided the design process, resulting in an app that caters to the
            specific requirements of Users. By prioritizing user needs, Notefege delivers a
